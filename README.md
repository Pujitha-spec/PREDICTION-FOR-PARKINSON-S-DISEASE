Our main moto is to develop a Machine Learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has Parkinson’s disease based on the symptoms and other factors.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bc39a2d-69a0-42ba-bc37-11d2ae7827c3)
Firstly, Parkinson’s Disease is a Neurodegenerative disorder that affects movements. It is  caused   by the  death of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

The model should be able to classify patients as having Parkinson’s or not with a high degree of accuracy.

There are many Medications that can reduce Parkinson’s symptoms, such as levodopa and dopamine.

Parkinson’s Disease is ongoing and potential treatments. Which recommended to consult medical professional for better cure.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f4866af-f7de-4b99-b996-373b1d7f7760)
Parkinson's disease prediction is based on voice recognition. 
So here, We predict the problem using the machine learning domain under which the SVM algorithm plays a major role.
Support Vector Machines (SVM) can assist in overcoming some of the difficulties associated with Parkinson's disease prediction.
SVM has been used with success in a number of medical applications, including the categorization and forecasting of disease. 
Here are some of the issues that SVM can resolve:
 High-Dimensional Data, Non-Linear Separability.
